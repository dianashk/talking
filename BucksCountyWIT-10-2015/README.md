# [Bucks County Woment in Technology Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BucksCounty-WIT)
### October 2015

This 20 minute talk was on the merits and shortcomings of the open-source community.
Women are grossly underrepresented in this space, far more so than even in general IT.
But open-source has the potential for women to really be accepted because it takes gender, age, education, etc out of the equation and all that's left is the merit of your contribution.
It seems that there just isn't enough information out there for women, and anyone for that matter to see a clear path for involvement.
This talks offers a bit of background and a few suggestions for where to start.
